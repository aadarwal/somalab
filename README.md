# somalab

the trial.c was some initial attempt at trying something different with C, mostly redundant stuff unless you also know how to approach it from there so just added it incase. 

The though process for solving is in thoughts.org (also at the bottom of this incase emacs org files are not liked) 

Also something that i noticed when going through the site on my phone: there seems to be a problem with the readability of a particular passage... i think this could be fixed by

This was my initial thought process: txt files --> main.py + payload.json --> input results --> fine tuning using llama ----> final results... need to validate if this is a correct flow.

the curl command is in running.py file and the results are also there (both of these are comments at the bottom) 

\\  website problem: On phones, atleast Iphones, i noticed that text was being cutoff when reading through the somalab website. I have attached a pic in the repo itself and imo its important info being cutoff and so just wanted to bring it to your notice. from what i know about webflow, i think it might be the breakpoints for mobile devices that would need to be toggled with it fix it I assume. Hope that helps.
