With the main goals as mentioned in the document being
1) accuracy
2) patient specific capabailities
3) latency

   hence goal is to create the most accurate negativity analysis system.

So I would assign ratings  on the following scales:
Overall negativity (0-10): 
Perceived judgment/criticism (0-5):
Potential for anxiety/stress (0-5): 
Empathy/rapport building (-5 to +5):

And then wanted to flow in the form of txt files --> main.py + test.json --> input results --> fine tuning using llama ----> final results


Effectively then out of the three ideas for improvement mentioned in the document
i could with this system implement a sentiment analysis API, fine tuning, and incorporate case specific guidelines based on patient context.
the main thing that could be furthered improved from this then remains implementing a mixture of experts or a tree of thought approach, which would be a more advanced, multi-path analysis.
